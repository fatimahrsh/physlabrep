Scientific Computing and modeling project This project is a simulation for Newton's seconed law's experiment, you will find the poster and codes that descraibe everything. Newton is best known for three very important principles of physics called classical mechanics. These principles describe how things move and are referred to today by his name - Newton's Laws of Motion. There are three of them, Newtons First, Second and Third Law of Motion. Newtons second law answers the question of what happens to an object that has nonzero resultant force acting on it. THe objectives are: 1- Verifying Newton's Second Law of motion using python. 2- Calculating the theoretical acceleration value, acceleration experimental value, and then compare the results in percentage error using python. Theory: Newton’s second law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to the object’s mass, Newton's second law can be expressed as following: ∑ F=ma Screenshot (27) Equipment List: 1-Dynamics Cart with Track 2-Set of Hanging Masses 3-Two Photogates 4-Smart Timer 5-Ruler 6-String 7- mass scale 8-Air blower (the magic happen with this equipment) Screenshot (28) Experimental Procedure:

Arrange the equipment as shown in picture above
Use the mass scale to measure the mass of the dynamics cart (M) with string and the hanging mass (m). Record the values of M & min data sheet table.
Attach the hanging mass to the cart. Make sure the string is long enough so that the entire cart successfully goes through the photogate before the hanging mass hits the floor
Adjust air blower as demonstrated by the instructor to make the track frictionless.
Adjust the photogates so that they are 20 cm apart. Adjust the heights of the photogates so that they are triggered by the same portion of the photogate sail
Pull the cart back to the first photogate and press the reset key on the Smart Timer to ready the timer
Release the cart. The travelling time (t1) through the selected distance (X) should appear on the Smart Timer, record the value of (t1) in data sheet table. And then for trial 2 record (t2) in the table.
Repeat steps 4, 5 & 6 for different distances (40-60-80-100 cm)
Find the average time for each distance and record it in the table.
Plot distance t^2 in x axis versus x in y axis, fit the data with a straight-line crossing (0,0) then calculate the slope
Calculate the acceleration aexp and compare this value with the theoretical acceleration ath by computing the percent difference between these two values
